# Intro about Impact Protocol
Impact Protocol is one of the first chains with a hybrid consensus mechanism. It has the power of both PoW(proof of work) and PoS(proof of stake). The Impact protocol is built on a substrate framework, and it is a modular framework that allows developers to be easy and efficient. Impact follows the thought process of building a multichain future. It will have around 100 parachains connected and running in parallel, with 10000 to 100000 transactions per second.

## Dapps on impactchain or any of the connected parachains

## Description:
We offer a bounty for building dApps that drive adoption for the impact chains. Impact protocol can develop both substrate-based 
smart contracts using the ink natively and EVM-based smart contracts using solidity, vyper etc. The community of developers can build dApps on impact protocol without any language limitation to develop and deploy apps.

### Example project ideas:
 - Building a dex
 - Native substrate based wallet(could be multi-sig)
 - Defi platform
 - NFT marketplace
 - Digital identities
 - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

### Submission Requirements:
Create an issue presenting the idea and description of the dApps you are planning to build following the similar format as shown below
 - Please include in your submission’s readme file:
 - Project title
 - Project description (minimum 150 words)
 - Name of bounty
 - Names of parachains you have built with for your cross-parachain DApp
 - Provide a way to access the project for judging and testing by including a link to a repo hosting the application’s code and any other deployment files and testing instructions.
